# infoAR

There's a lot inefficiencies in the workplace. Especially in a manufacturing or factory environment, it takes a lot of time to check the status of machinery equipment on the spot.

Using AR technology, we have designed an app that takes equipment data and information a and displays it in augmented reality through the use of unique image and codes associated to each piece of equipment. This will improve worker efficiency and safety by displaying machine statistics, allowing quicker response times to failures and errors.

Built using Unity and Android Studios
